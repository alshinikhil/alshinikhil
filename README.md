# Hi there, I'm Nikhil Alshi

Thanks for stopping by — here’s a little about me.

I'm a graduate student in Information Systems at Northeastern University with professional experience as a Data Analyst at Capgemini. I specialize in building scalable data pipelines, optimizing data models, and creating analytics solutions that improve decision-making and operational efficiency. I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering and business intelligence, where technical solutions translate directly into business impact.
